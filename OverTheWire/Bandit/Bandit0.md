Simple Connection over SSH to Bandit Servers.

**Host**: bandit.labs.overthewire.org
**Port**: 2220

## How to [[SSH]]

```
ssh -p port_number user@IP
```

I used ls to list out files and found a readme which should contain a password for the next level.

To view the contents of the file, I used the cat command.
